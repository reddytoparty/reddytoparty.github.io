        <h2>YOU ARE INVITED!</h2>
        <p><strong>What: An 'S'-pectacular Party!</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Where: <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/rkUqzZd3rNiLe3r57">https://maps.app.goo.gl/rkUqzZd3rNiLe3r57</a></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Suit up as anything or anyone starting with the letter 'S' - a famous fictional character, a real life celebrity or even just a quotidian object. From Sherlock Holmes to SpongeBob SquarePants, whether you're a sneaky spy, a surfing shark, or a super-duper superhero, get creative and let your imagination run wild!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Don't forget to BYOB to keep the 'S'pirits high so that the scandals have a reason to drop by (JK guys, it just rhymed and sounded cool - this is a safe space, no need to worry about any scandals). We promise to keep the snacks coming and the music thumping all night long!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> All you lovely 'S'luts under one roof?!?!? CAN'T WAIT.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">PS: hehe, made y'all google the meaning of quotidian. SUCK IT BIYCHESSSS
